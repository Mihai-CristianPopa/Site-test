         <p>The series' tags on IMDB are: Crime, Drama, Thriller. </p>
         <p>Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan.
              The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes.
               It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified,
                and dispirited high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. Walter turns to a life of crime,
                 partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by producing and distributing crystal meth to secure his family's financial future before he dies,
                  while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld.
              According to Gilligan, the title is a Southern colloquialism meaning "to raise hell".</p>

                'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.

                Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.
                
                Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.
                
                Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.
                
                The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.
                
                Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.
                
                Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox. ("Posted on : 13 November 2017")

                Bryan Cranston shows his acting skills portraying the complex character of Walter White. He's a long suffering high school chemistry teacher who suddenly finds he's dying of cancer. With little prospect of leaving anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make meth. They're so good at it that they become major criminals.

This is the best of television which can be found on cable. Walter White is a complex character that actually grows over the life of the show.
 He is a good character that we root for at the beginning even thought he's become a criminal. The journey he makes is one worthy of great literature.
  It is absolutely must see TV. ("Posted on : 30 September 2013")

                I like the bit where they make crystal meth in the back of an RV. ("Posted on : 30 March 2020")
